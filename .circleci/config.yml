     # GCP_SA (The GCP security token that allows for syncing to the GCP Object storage bucket)
     #### GCP variables that will likely move to Orb parameters:
     # GCP_BUCKET (set to static.pantheonfrontend.website)
     # GCP_COMPUTE_ZONE (set to us-central1)
     # GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID (set to webops-prototypes)
